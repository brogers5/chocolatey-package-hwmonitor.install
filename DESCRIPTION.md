## HWMonitor

HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that aggregates several data points from from your PC hardware's sensors, and enables easy tracking of current and some historical (minimum and maximum) values, which can optionally be saved for future reference. These can be useful for performance tests, benchmarks, and troubleshooting.

## Package Notes

The installer executed by this package was built using Inno Setup. For advanced setup scenarios, refer to [Inno Setup's command-line interface documentation](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline). Any desired arguments can be appended to (or optionally overriding with the `--override-arguments` switch) the package's default install arguments with the `--install-arguments` option.

Installer-specific details (e.g. Setup configuration and supported Languages, Components, and Tasks) can be found in the Inno Setup Script file, which has been extracted using [Inno Setup Unpacker](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/innounp) and [reuploaded for quick reference](https://github.com/brogers5/chocolatey-package-hwmonitor.install/tree/v1.57.0/install_script.iss).

For future upgrade operations, consider opting into Chocolatey's `useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades` feature to avoid having to pass the same arguments with each upgrade:

```shell
choco feature enable --name="'useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades'"
```
